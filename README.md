# [Samarjit Debnath](https://samarjitdebnath.github.io/)

🙋🏻‍♂️ Experienced Software Engineer and Machine Learning Specialist with a background in scalable system design and data pipeline engineering. At Optum India, I developed a UNIFAI-style orchestration for models, cutting `processing time from weeks to minutes`, and deployed scalable production systems. My feature engineering and ML model evaluation improved disease event prediction accuracy by `2.5-3%`. I also built cloud-based ML models and data pipelines, achieving `98.5% accuracy` in reproducing historical ML runs.

At Kinara, Inc., I contributed to the design of software tools for the ARA-1 chip and developed a System API trace tool. My technical skills include Python, C/C++, Azure Databricks, Apache Airflow, and various ML/DL frameworks. I hold a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Agartala, where I created an IoT-based Smart Agriculture System. My software development and machine learning expertise drive impactful solutions in the healthcare and technology sectors.
